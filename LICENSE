# Pure NumPy Transformer (No PyTorch, No Autograd)

A complete Transformer Encoder implemented **entirely in NumPy**. Includes forward/backward passes for all components (Multi-Head Attention, LayerNorm, FFN) and trains successfully with Adam.

## Why?
- Understand Transformer internals without deep learning frameworks
- Full backprop implementation (the hard part!)
- 0 dependencies: just `numpy`

## Results
- 500 epochs: MSE loss drops to ~0.004 (near-perfect reconstruction)
- See `train()` function for demo

## Usage
```bash
pip install numpy  # (if needed)
python transformer_numpy.py
